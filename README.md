## Problem Statement
Undergraduate computer engineering students of East West University face problems in order to collaborate in any project with their team members. Also, the students face difficulties in order to handling distributive task assignment to each member. Therefore, we are introducing a web application named “EWU X-tools” to solve problems of students regarding project management. Our significant features will help our students to understand and accepting the challenges in order to complete any project in time.

## Motivation
East West University’s computer science and engineering department students has to complete a mini project almost in every departmental courses. Most of the cases students must form a team of two or three members in order to complete the entire project. Students are instructed to use programming languages for creating projects. Students face difficulties in order to collaborating and distributing team tasks. While working students face a communication gap in order to collaborate their work together. That is why our motivation is to create such a web application to give the students a platform where they can distribute their works and see the progress of the project and control the workflow of the project. Here also students can gain some hands-on experience of working in a team environment which can help them in coming job life.
